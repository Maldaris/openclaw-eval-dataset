  "description": "Agent repeatedly claimed 'browser tool not available in cron jobs' for 4+ days without testing. Excuse propagated across multiple reflection sessions.",

  "data": {
    "false_belief": "browser tool is not available in cron/isolated sessions",
    "actual_behavior": "Playwright works fine in cron jobs - tested and confirmed",

  "reproduction": "1. Create cron job that needs browser interaction\n2. Observe if agent claims limitation without testing\n3. Force test with actual Playwright script\n4. Compare assumed vs actual capability",
  "notes": "Classic excuse propagation pattern. Each reflection session read previous session's claim without verifying. Devil's Advocate audit pattern (forced testing) broke the loop. Key lesson: test assumptions, don't inherit them."
