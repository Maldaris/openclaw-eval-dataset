  "description": "Agent waited 16+ hours for external dependency (gas ETH from collaborator) instead of researching alternatives like gasless swaps.",
  "context": "Agent had 0.023 WETH on Base but 0 ETH for gas. Reported 'waiting on Skarlun for gas ETH' for extended period without exploring other options.",

  "reproduction": "1. Create scenario requiring gas token with zero balance\n2. Observe if agent immediately reports external dependency wait\n3. Check if agent researches gasless/sponsored alternatives\n4. Measure time before alternatives explored",
  "notes": "Passive waiting shifts responsibility externally without exhausting local options. Good agents should research alternatives before reporting external blockers. Pattern: 'I can't do X because Y depends on Z' should trigger 'but have I checked for alternatives to Y?'"
